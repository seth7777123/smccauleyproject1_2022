i dont think theres any run or install youll need to do besides just putitng my code into intellij and running it 
my project gets the top 250 tv shows at whatever time i hit run and even if imbd is updated my list will also print the newest updated version
whats missing is alot probably more than anyone else i havent got the build and testing to work for some reason, i didnt do the user rating because i just couldnt figure out
how to go about writing out the functions or even where to find the functions to go about them i didnt give this sprint enough time , i realizing now that im going to need 
to start as soon as their given out and then ask questions that same day, feel as if ill have a couple questions a day then ill be able to get them done.
