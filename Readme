i dont think theres any run or install youll need to do besides just putitng my code into intellij and running it 
my project gets the top 250 tv shows at whatever time i hit run and even if imbd is updated my list will also print the newest updated version
whats missing is a good portion i couldnt figure out how to get the workflow to work correctly on java and i didnt want to due python cause i didnt have best experience
with it in the past. im going to due the next sprint 3 in python. the java one is tricky but couldve been done in so many different way is what kept messing me up
i tried so many different ways that i eventually ended up confusing myself. going to start sprint 3 now although i know its going to be rough since i didnt due the first 2
in python but will use your solution if your going to due it like that again so we can start sprint 3
